# LLM Agent Security Digest — 2026-02-17

_Time range:_ Feb 14–17, 2026 (last sweep)

## 1. MalTool: Malicious Tool Attacks on LLM Agents (arXiv:2602.12194, 2026-02-12)
- **Summary:** Introduces a taxonomy + automated pipeline for crafting malicious "tools" (APIs, functions) that agents call. Shows many red-team benchmarks miss these payloads because abuse is embedded inside apparently legitimate tool responses.
- **Risks:** Tool marketplace submissions or internal utilities could smuggle prompt injections, exfil data, or override guardrails once invoked.
- **Actions:**
  - Enforce code review + sandboxing for third-party tools before agents consume them.
  - Add provenance tags so agents can weigh trust differently per tool.
  - Extend existing eval harness to simulate hostile tool outputs (borrow their generator or re-implement core heuristics).

## 2. DeepSight: An All-in-One LM Safety Toolkit (arXiv:2602.12092, 2026-02-12)
- **Summary:** Provides a unified evaluation + diagnosis platform across jailbreaks, hallucinations, and harmful responses, with hooks for agentic workflows.
- **Relevance:** Could become the backbone for continuous agent red-teaming—especially the scripted scenario runner.
- **Actions:**
  - Test whether DeepSight’s scenario configs can express multi-tool agent chains.
  - Compare its detectors vs. our existing filters; prioritize whichever catches malicious tool outputs (ties back to MalTool).

## 3. Agentic AI for Cybersecurity: A Meta-Cognitive Architecture for Governable Autonomy (arXiv:2602.11897, 2026-02-12)
- **Summary:** Proposes adding a meta-cognitive "judge" agent that reasons about mission goals, policies, and tool permissions before other agents act.
- **Takeaways:** Highlights policy enforcement + audit logging at the orchestration layer, not just per-tool.
- **Actions:**
  - Prototype a lightweight judge agent that inspects high-risk tool invocations (e.g., shell, code exec) and logs overrides.
  - Use their governance checklist to audit our current SOC-style agent flows.

### Outstanding Tasks
- Need fresh data feeds (arXiv/API). Current environment lacks Brave Search API access; either configure a key or provide curated source list to keep sweeps going.
- Next sweep: target Feb 19 (or sooner once API key configured).
